            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a fresh perspective and a love for creating clean, modern, and functional websites. My journey into coding started with curiosity, and since then, I've been diving into front-end development, learning languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring frameworks such as Angular. I also focus on building back-end applications using Python and Flask.

                As a fresher, I’m excited about learning and growing while working on real-world projects. I believe coding is an art form, where every line of code contributes to something meaningful. Whether it's designing user interfaces, optimizing performance, or ensuring a seamless user experience, I aim to deliver quality in all my work.
                
                I'm eager to take on new challenges, collaborate with others, and continue expanding my knowledge. I’m always open to learning and bringing fresh ideas to the table!</p>
